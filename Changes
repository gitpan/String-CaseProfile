Revision history for Perl extension String::CaseProfile.

0.06  June 4, 2008

    * Moved the $word_re compiled regex definition to the top-level (to avoid
      compiling it every time the get_profile function is called), declaring
      it as a global package variable
    * Turned the %types global lexical variable into a global package variable

0.05  February 3, 2008

    * Added the copy_profile convenience function
    * Updated the documentation

0.04  January 29, 2008

    * Removed the consonants_rx compilation, since this regex is used only once
      in every call to _word_type
    * Improved the synopsis and made minor changes to other sections of the
      documentation
